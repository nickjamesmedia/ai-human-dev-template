# Constraints (Current)

## Hard rules
- Produce only Markdown files.
- Do not generate application code.
- Prefer clarity over verbosity.
- One active plan at a time; rolling task lists.
- Assume Windows users and VS Code by default.
- No framework or language assumptions.

## Operating rules
- Keep "current" sections at the top; append older entries below.
- Avoid per-task file explosion; reuse `.agent/` files.
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous.
- Do not optimize, generalize, or expand scope unless explicitly requested.

## Stop conditions
- If constraints conflict, stop and ask before proceeding.
- If required information is missing, do not guess.

## Notes (append-only)
- 2026-01-03: Constraints established from repository requirements.
