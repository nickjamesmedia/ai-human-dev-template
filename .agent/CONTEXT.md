# Context (Current)

## Purpose
Reusable template for AI/Human hybrid development with structured, intentional workflows.

## Scope
- Documentation-only repository; no application code.
- Works for Codex and non-Codex agents.
- Windows and VS Code are the default assumptions.

## Non-goals
- This repo is not a framework or starter app.
- This repo does not prescribe languages, tools, or architectures.
- This repo does not automate development decisions.

## Working assumptions
- Prefer minimal, practical updates over exhaustive detail.
- Use `.agent/` files as the shared source of truth for humans and agents.

## Notes (append-only)
- 2026-01-03: Repository initialized as a lightweight template skeleton.
