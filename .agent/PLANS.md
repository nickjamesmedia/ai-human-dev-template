# Plan (Active)

## Status
- In progress.

## Goal
- Add a tool-agnostic skills system with a template and starter skills.

## Non-goals
- No scripts or application code.
- No framework or language assumptions.
- No expansion beyond requested skills and brief README mention.

## Approach
- Add skills docs under `skills/` using short, checklist-first format.
- Update root `README.md` with a brief skills mention.
- Update `.agent/PLANS.md` and `.agent/TASKS.md` to reflect this work.

## Steps
- Step 1: Create `skills/` docs (README, template, and three starter skills).
- Step 2: Update root `README.md` with a short skills reference.
- Step 3: Update `.agent/PLANS.md` and `.agent/TASKS.md`.

## Validation
- Confirm files exist and follow the required section format.
- Confirm README mention is brief and non-invasive.
