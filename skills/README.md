# Skills

This directory contains small, tool-agnostic skills for deliberate AI/human workflows.
Each skill is a short checklist you can follow as-is or adapt.

## How to use

1. Pick the relevant skill.
2. Read required inputs.
3. Follow the procedure step-by-step.
4. Stop when the stop conditions are met.

## Conventions

- Keep skills short and practical.
- Prefer checklists over long explanations.
- Use the template in `skills/_skill-template/skill.md` for new skills.
